Build HOWTO:

Extract source code:
    tar xzf spgdb.tar.gz
This will extract a "spgdb" directory.
Extract library source code:
    tar xzf spgdb_library.tar.gz
This will extract a "spgdb_library" directory.

Prepare build directory (for Linux):
    mkdir -p $YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTOY/build/Linux
    cd $YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTOY/build/Linux

Build debug version:
    mkdir spgdb
    cd spgdb
    ../../../spgdb/buildSpgdb.sh -libs

Note:
    The option -libs can be omitted in later builds.

Build release version:
    mkdir spgdb-O3
    cd spgdb-O3
    ../../../spgdb/buildSpgdb.sh -libs

See also the note from the debug build.

Prepare build directory (for Cygwin):
    mkdir -p $YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTOY/build/Cygwin
    cd $YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTOY/build/Cygwin

Build debug/release version:
    The same commands as for Linux (see above).

Summary, the directory structure should look like:
Downward from YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTOY:
    source code:
      spgdb/gdb/
      spgdb/...
    debug build (Linux):
      build/Linux/spgdb/gdb/
      build/Linux/spgdb/gdb/spgdb
      build/Linux/spgdb/local/
      build/Linux/spgdb/...
    release build (Linux):
      build/Linux/spgdb-O3/gdb/
      build/Linux/spgdb-O3/gdb/spgdb
      build/Linux/spgdb-O3/local/
      build/Linux/spgdb-O3/...
    debug build (Cygwin):
      build/Cygwin/spgdb/gdb/
      build/Cygwin/spgdb/gdb/spgdb.exe
      build/Cygwin/spgdb/local/
      build/Cygwin/spgdb/...
    release build (Cygwin):
      build/Cygwin/spgdb-O3/gdb/
      build/Cygwin/spgdb-O3/gdb/spgdb.exe
      build/Cygwin/spgdb-O3/local/
      build/Cygwin/spgdb-O3/...
